<h1>EventSheet</h1>
<p>The event sheet is the code behind the game. For example in the event sheet, I coded the spawn time for the spikes and how fast they fall down.
    I also edited the points you get by setting a timer. The effect when you get hit is also in the event sheet. Also, when you die, the menu pops up on your screen, which is also done in the event sheet/  </p>
